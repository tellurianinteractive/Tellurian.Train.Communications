## Documentation Guidelines

### Reserved Folders
**IMPORTANT**: Exclude documents in folders named "Non-essential specifications", ""Processed documents" or similar. 
These contain supplementary information that is not required for development work. 
Focus on the essential specifications and code documentation instead.

### Code Comments
- Ensure all public classes, methods, properties, and interfaces have XML documentation comments.
- Don't document private or internal members unless they contain complex logic that requires explanation.
- Avoid redundant comments that restate the code. Focus on explaining the "why" and any non-obvious behavior.
