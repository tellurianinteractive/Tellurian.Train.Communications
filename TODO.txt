You have made many classes, structs, records, methods and properties public. I am not convinced that this is necessary. I want a library with a minimum of functionality exposed, only make public what is expected to be used by an external client application. If you need to access something in tests only, make access internal and make internals visible to tests.

I can see that a lot of methods and contructors throw exceptions when input values are not correct. This way of conding introduces a risk of code failures in runtime. Instead of throwing exceptions, I want you to use a struct Result<T> type, with two properties: Success and Failure. Success returns a value of type T, and Failure has a propery Exception. The Failure can then be used to ether examine the Exception or throw it. It is also practical to have boolean properties IsSuccess and IsFailure. An option is to support AggregateException, which makes it possible to return multiple exceptions if several errors occurs.
